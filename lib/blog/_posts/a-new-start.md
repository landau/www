I've finally decided to take writing a **coding blog** *seriously*. There are a couple of reasons in which why:

- The programming community gains another resource.
- Teaching is one of the best ways to learn.

If you're still reading, then you're probably interested in what kind of **code blog** this is. The posts found in this blog will discuss programming topics. As a **JavaScript** lover, many posts will frequently contain posts on said technology. There will of course be the occasional life event posts (job changes, meetups, blog updates, etc). If you're still interested, please add my [RSS feed](/rss) to your choice of reader so you get updates. If you don't use one, consider following me on twitter [@trevor_landau](http://www.twitter.com/trevor_landau), where I will tweet all new posts (I also tweet/retweet articles from others).

I'm hoping to release one article every week or two. No guarantees though! I am usually quite busy taking an online course through [Coursera](http://coursera.org), reading other blogs, or coding, so that release cycle probably won't hold. I will post a list of interesting articles I've been reading during to make up for any lack of posting.

I will also be adding a Disqus commenting engine soon so you can make fun of me.

Thats it for my first post. I hope you come back for more.
